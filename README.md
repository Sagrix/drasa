# drasa
Drasa is an anonymous messaging platform that connects patients to healthcare professionals in situations where they would have been limited by stigma surrounding their health issues.

> **drasa** is a mnemonic for _**Dr**. **A**meyo **S**tella **A**dadevoh_, a Nigerian physician who paid the ultimate price while curbing the 2014 ebola epidemic in West Africa. This project is named in memory of her.
